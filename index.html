    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>As an aeronautical engineer pursuing a Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering through research, I am committed to
            advancing the field of aerospace engineering through my expertise in State Estimation, control systems, Modelling and
            simulation. Currently, I am conducting my thesis work on state estimation using the extended Kalman filter algorithm at DRDL
            Hyderabad, where I have honed my skills in scientific computing and data analysis using programming languages such as C,
            MATLAB, and Fortran. In addition, my knowledge of web development and design, including HTML and CSS, has allowed me to
            create engaging and informative. With a collaborative spirit and a drive to succeed, I am eager to apply my skills and
            experience to contribute to the cutting-edge projects in the aerospace industry
